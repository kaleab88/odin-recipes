    <h2>ingrdients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm <strong> water </strong>(110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry <strong>yeast</strong></li>
        <li>1 pinch white <strong>sugar</strong></li>
        <li>3 â…“ cups all-purpose <strong>flour</strong></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon <strong> olive oil</strong></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher <strong>salt </strong></li>
        <li>2 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped <strong>fresh basil </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast
            softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
        <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for
            1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl.
            Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
        <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the
            bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.</li>
        <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and
            basil.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat
            with second piece of dough.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
